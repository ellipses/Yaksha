## Yaksha

A general purpose discord and IRC bot written in Python. Uses Async version of discord.py and IRC3 for each version of the bot. 

A custom interface.py module is used instead of the discord cog extension to provide compatibility between the versions. 

## Running the bot

While its possible to self host the bot, I would prefer if you invited the bot to your channel using [invite link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=194156698150240257&scope=bot&permissions=0x00000c00).
