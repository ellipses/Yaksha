'''
Module that functions as an interface between the commands and the irc/discord
libaries. Provides a common inteface that allows the commands to function the
same regardless of which version of the bot is instantiated.

There are three main components to the interface class. remap_functions which
creates a dictionary of commands and the functions, call_command which
handles each valid command received by the bot and user_has_permission
which checks if the user has permission to call the specific command.
